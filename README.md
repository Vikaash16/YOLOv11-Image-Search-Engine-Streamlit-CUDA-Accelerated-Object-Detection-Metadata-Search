# YOLOv11-Image-Search-Engine-Streamlit-CUDA-Accelerated-Object-Detection-Metadata-Search
GPU-accelerated image search engine using YOLOv11, PyTorch, and Streamlit. Perform object detection on image folders, generate metadata, and search images by objects, class counts, and logical conditions (AND/OR).

# YOLOv11 Image Search Engine  
### GPU-Accelerated Object Detection, Metadata Search & Streamlit Frontend

A fully interactive **computer vision powered search engine** built with **YOLOv11**, **Streamlit**, and **PyTorch (CUDA enabled)**.  
This app runs object detection on images, stores metadata, and enables Google-like search queries on image content.

Ideal for:
- Dataset exploration  
- Smart filtering  
- Visual search  
- Rapid CV prototyping  
- Object-based analytics

## Project Features

### Object Detection
- Runs YOLOv11 on entire image folders  
- Saves bounding boxes, class names, confidence scores  
- Automatically generates `metadata.json`

### Search Engine
Search images based on:
- Selected classes (Person, Car, Cat, Banana, etc.)  
- AND / OR mode  
- Class count thresholds  
- Highlight matching detections  

### Streamlit UI
- Responsive grid layout  
- Toggle bounding boxes  
- Adjustable grid size  
- Downloadable JSON results  
- GPU/CPU status display  

### GPU-Powered
- Uses **PyTorch CUDA** for fast inference  
- Works with NVIDIA GPUs (MX, GTX, RTX series)
